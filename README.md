As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business


What? 
This project will seek to create a command line app, using NodeJs, that allows the user to update existing employess, add new ones and manage the overall buisness. 

Why?
A Content Managment System is essenital for businesses to streamline the devlopment of applications, or generally manage there team. Without this, it would be much harder for everyone in the business to work becuase they all wouldnt be on the same page. 

How? 
Using MySQL Queries, along with Inquirer (that is run in nodejs) This app will dynamically managae a databse and then use modules that will display the information nicley in the command line.
